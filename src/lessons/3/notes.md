# Notes

## In Three.js, for textures types, `NormalMap`, `DisplacementMap`, `RoughnessMap`, `MetalnessMap`, `EmissiveMap`, `AOMap`, `EnvMap`, `LightMap`, `SpecularMap`, `AlphaMap`, `DiffuseMap`, what are they, how to use them, and how to optimize them, and how to create custom texture types

## What PBR (Physically Based Rendering) is, how it works, and how to implement it in Three

## Tell me about basic theory of physically based rendering (PBR) and how it is implemented in Three.js

## Tell me about UV unwrapping, what it is, how it works, and how to do it in Blender, Three.js, and other 3D software and how to optimize it

## Tell me about the mipmapping, what it is, how it works, and how to use it in Three.js

## In Three.js `texture.generateMipmaps = false` what does it do, and how to use it, and when not to use it

## For Textures in Three.js, what are `map` and `mapcap`, how they work, and how to use them

## What is sRGB, how it works, and how to use it in Three.js
